# Tweetalyzer
Data visualization tool which displays real-time sentiment analysis of tweets on a given topic.

Tweetalyze uses a Node.js back-end to tap the Twitter Streaming API, perform sentiment analysis of the user's search query, and feed the resulting data into the AngularJS 1.6 front-end by way of the Highcharts.js charting library.

Tweetalyze was developed by Christina Parkhurst and <a href="https://github.com/wallergoble">Waller Goble.</a>

## Future Development
